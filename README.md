# Excel_portfolio_project

This is my Excel project for my portfolio. In this project I use a dataset "Cars - Purchase Decision Dataset" from Kaggle, here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielsantello/cars-purchase-decision-dataset. Using this dataset I prepare data for further analysis creating additional fields "Age brackets" and "Salary brackets", where I use Excel functions to break age and salary into three categories. I also create pivot tables and visualizations using these pivot tables. Finally, I create a dashboard that represents my analysis.
